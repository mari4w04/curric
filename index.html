                            <p>At the end of the first semester of the programme, students are evaluated individually based on a
                            presentation of one or more examples of products submitted in the first semester. During the first
                            semester, students work on a digital portfolio where they submit and evaluate their own assignments
                            together with the teachers. This is registered in a portfolio. The internal evaluation of the
                            portfolio and product presentation provides a framework for dialogue on the studentsâ€™ learning
                            and potential for development later in the programme.
                            The first-semester portfolio evaluation is a precondition for students being registered for the exam
                            in the compulsory programme element in the second semester (first-year exam)</p>

                              <p>A detailed description of the project requirements can be found on the learning platform for the
                                Multimedia Design and Communication programme and is intended to ensure that essential areas
                                in the first year of study are broadly combined. The project description sets out the requirements
                                regarding group size, product scope and process documentation. It is made available to the students,
